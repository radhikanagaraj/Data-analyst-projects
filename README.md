The project involves analysing the inbound calling data of a companyâ€™s CX team over a span of 
23 days. The dataset includes details such as agent names and IDs, queue time, call duration, 
and call status. The goal is to derive insights into customer behaviour satisfaction levels, and 
call volume trends. This analysis will aid in optimizing the customer support process, 
improving resource allocation, and assessing the effectiveness of advertising efforts in driving 
customer inquiries.
