The main objective of this project is to use EDA to identify patterns in loan application data 
that indicate if a customer is likely to have difficulty repaying their instalments. By 
understanding these patterns, the company aims to make informed decisions about loan 
approval to minimize the risk of default while ensuring capable applicants are not rejected.
